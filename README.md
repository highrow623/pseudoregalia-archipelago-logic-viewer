# Pseudoregalia Archipelago Logic Viewer

The purpose of this site is to provider Pseudoregalia Archipelago players insight into the apworld logic without having to parse the code.

The data was generated using a script that I haven't added to the repo yet (it is very messy).

## TODO

* Add the generation script to repo
* Create pages that show logic for individual connections (entrances, locations)
* Responsive layout/mobile compat?
